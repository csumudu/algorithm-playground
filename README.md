# Algorithm Playground
This application provides a visual representation of various algorithms, allowing users to observe their behavior in real time.

It leverages Recoil for state management, ensuring efficient rendering by updating only the necessary components instead of re-rendering the entire dataset when visual changes are applied to data cells.
